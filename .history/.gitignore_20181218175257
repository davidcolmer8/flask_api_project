Your env folder should be in the gitignore yeah, but it doesn't have to be in your project folder. You can put everything you want in your gitignore, mine looks like (for a really big project) for example :

# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
db.sqlite3
migrations/
media/
settings.py
# C extensions
*.so

# Distribution / packaging
.Python
env/
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg
inPyVenv/
.ipynb

# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as to inject date/other infos into it.
*.manifest
*.spec

# Installer logs
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt
